# AWS Code Challenge 

## Objective

To Build a serverless application using AWS services that process and store a userâ€™s schedule configuration. 

## Project Setup
- Clone this repo
- Install `AWS CDK CLI` by running this command: `npm i -g aws-cdk`
- Install all packages by running `npm i` 
- If its your first time of deploying infrastructure to you AWS environment using `CDK`, you need to boostrap the environment by running this comman: `cdk bootstrap`. Bootstrapping prepares your AWS environment by provisioning specific AWS resources in your environment that are used by the AWS CDK.
- Run `cdk synth` to emit the synthesized cloud formation template. 
- Run `cdk deploy` to deploy infrastructure 
- After a succssful deploy, there is an endpoint `GET {{baseurl}}/seed
` you can use to seed the database. This ensures required tables are created in the DB. See API documentation below for mor info.
